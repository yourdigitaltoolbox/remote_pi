- **Pairing** via short-lived QR code; peers persisted in Keychain (mobile) and `~/.pi/remote/` (desktop)
- **TLS in transit** on the WebSocket connection
- **Ed25519 pairing authentication** — only paired devices can route messages through your peer slot on the relay (challenge-response handshake)
- **The relay forwards opaque ciphertext** as far as routing is concerned, but the payload itself is **not end-to-end encrypted in the current version** — see [`relay/README.md`](./relay/README.md) for the security trade-offs

## Local agent mesh

When multiple Pi agents run on the same machine, they discover each other through
a **Unix Domain Socket broker** managed by the extension. One agent wins the
leader election and binds the socket; the others connect as clients. After that,
any agent can send a message or make a request to any other agent by name —
no relay, no network, no extra config.

Two LLM-facing tools are exposed in the Pi chat:

- `agent_send` — fire-and-forget message to another local agent
- `agent_request` — request/response with timeout

This lets you set up local multi-agent workflows (e.g. a `backend` agent asks a
`frontend` agent for help) entirely on your machine, in parallel with the remote
mobile pairing.

## Relay

A free community relay is available at:

```
wss://relay-rp1.jacobmoura.work
```

It's enough to get started, but the relay operator can see the content of your
messages and is a single point of trust for routing. **For sensitive work, we
strongly recommend running your own relay** — it's a single Docker command and
the only thing your traffic ever touches is your own infrastructure.

Full security trade-offs and the self-hosting guide live in
**[`relay/README.md`](./relay/README.md)**.

## Getting started

Install the Pi extension in any project where Pi runs:

```bash
pi install npm:remote-pi
```

### Exact Git installs

The repository root is also a deliberately small Pi package bridge for reviewed
Git commits. Pi invokes `npm install` at a Git package root; the root `prepare`
hook then uses pinned `pnpm@10.26.1` with `pi-extension/pnpm-lock.yaml` to
install and build `pi-extension/dist` before Pi discovers it. `dist` remains
ignored and is never committed. This is the only exception to the root's usual
planning/documentation convention.

```bash
pi install git:git@github.com:yourdigitaltoolbox/remote_pi@<full-40-character-sha>
```

Use only a reviewed full commit SHA. The bridge is not a global install and does
not alter an existing live Pi profile outside the package target selected by the
operator.

Then in the Pi chat, run:

```
/remote-pi
```

The setup wizard walks you through agent name, session name, and relay choice,
then prints a QR code. Scan it with the Remote Pi mobile app and you're paired.

## Statu

The MVP is functional. Planning notes and roadmap live in [`plan/`](./plan).

## License

License is per-package — see each subproject's `LICENSE` file (the `pi-extension`
is MIT). A repository-wide license decision is pending.
